Project summary
A fullscreen, terminal-style portfolio website where the terminal *is* the interface. Visitors explore projects by typing commands, like in a Linux shell. There is no real backend shell and no CMS; everything is intentionally simulated, static, and honest. Projects open through terminal commands as image, video, or 3D viewers while the terminal remains usable. The site is deployed as static files to shared hosting with a custom domain.

Core concept

* Terminal-first UI, not a themed website
* Linux-like prompt and behavior
* Commands drive navigation and interaction
* Folder-based content, build-time generated
* Static deployment, zero runtime backend

Key features

* Fullscreen terminal using a real terminal emulator
* Command parser with realistic responses
* Proper error handling (`command not found`, usage errors)
* Command history, tab autocomplete
* Tasteful terminal gimmicks (whoami, uname, neofetch, etc.)
* Bottom hint bar that injects and executes commands
* Projects open via terminal into image, video, or 3D viewers
* Terminal always stays interactive

Commands (MVP)

* `help` – list commands
* `projects` – list available projects
* `project <name>` – open project viewer
* `close` – close viewer
* `contact` – contact info
* `imprint` – legal notice
* `clear` – clear terminal

Content model

* Each project is a folder on disk
* Folder contains `meta.json` and media files
* Folder name acts as project “directory”
* Build script scans folders and generates a single JSON index
* Updating content = change folders, rebuild, upload

Deployment model

* Build locally on macOS
* Upload static `dist/` directory to hosting provider
* Works on Strato, IONOS, Proton, or any static host
* Custom domain and HTTPS supported

Tech stack
Frontend

* React + Vite
* TypeScript
* xterm.js (terminal emulator)
* three.js (3D viewer)
* Plain CSS or Tailwind

Build-time tooling

* Node.js script for folder scanning and JSON generation

Backend

* None

Analytics (optional)

* Plausible or Umami
* Events: command executed, project opened, viewer closed

Non-goals

* No real shell access
* No CMS or admin UI
* No runtime backend logic
* No authentication
* No SEO gimmicks

Bottom line
This project is a clean, static, terminal-driven portfolio that demonstrates engineering taste, system thinking, and restraint rather than framework overload.

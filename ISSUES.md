- **Terminal messaging:** Friendlier error text and command output – see `TODO.md` Task 9.

---

## Completed Fixes

- ✅ Viewer `onClose` prop fixed (was missing from destructuring).
- ✅ Unused `PROMPT` import removed from `displayLogo.ts`.
- ✅ Terminal `exitGame` useCallback dependency fixed (`displayLogoAndWelcomeCallback`).

## Previous Issues (Resolved)

### Game Exit Terminal State Restoration (RESOLVED)
**Solution**: Simplified approach - games now reset terminal to initial state (logo + welcome) when exiting, providing a clean, consistent experience.

### ANSI Logo Mobile Sizing (RESOLVED)
**Solution**: Mobile logo uses 8px font size (half of 16px) during logo rendering, then restores to 16px for regular text. Logo also uses smaller width percentage on mobile.

### Text Wrapping on Mobile (RESOLVED)
**Solution**: Welcome text and help text use manual line breaks on mobile for better readability, and font size reduced slightly (15px) to improve wrapping.

### Game Layout on Mobile (RESOLVED)
**Solution**: Games use full terminal width on mobile, taking ~40% of screen height. Mobile controls use full width with larger buttons for better touch targets.

### Mobile Controls on iPad (RESOLVED)
**Solution**: Changed from screen-size-based detection to touch capability detection. Controls now appear on all touch devices (phones, tablets, iPads of any size) regardless of screen dimensions.

### Landscape Mode Game Layout (RESOLVED)
**Solution**: Games now detect landscape orientation and use horizontal split - game takes ~60% width on left, controls positioned on right side. Games automatically restart when orientation changes.

### Terminal Display Issue (RESOLVED)
**Solution**: Fixed CSS @import statements to be at the top of global.css (CSS requirement). Added immediate fitAddon.fit() call after terminal initialization for proper sizing.

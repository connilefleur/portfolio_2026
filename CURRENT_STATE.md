# Current State

## Stack

- React 18 + Vite + TypeScript
- Entry: `src/main.tsx`
- App shell: `src/App.tsx`
- Styling: `src/styles/tokens.css`, `src/styles/layout.css`

## Navigation Model

- Tile IDs: `landing`, `about-me`, `work-together`, `recognition`, and dynamic `project-<slug>`
- Registry generated by `getTileRegistry(projects)` in `src/canvas/tileRegistry.ts`
- Canvas translates with `translate3d(...)` in `src/canvas/CanvasEngine.tsx`
- URL is synchronized with `?tile=<id>`
- Active landing nav stack order: `Contact` first, `Imprint` last
- `about-me` code is retained but deactivated from tile registry/navigation

## Landing Intro

- Intro phases: `active -> exiting -> done`
- Deep links to non-landing tiles start with `done`
- Fullscreen black overlay shrinks to landing frame target
- Center intro label uses site name and morphs/moves to landing top-left brand position
- Trigger mode:
  - Hover/focus on pointer-fine devices
  - Tap/click on touch/coarse devices

## Nav Interaction Affordance

- Global red "rope line" overlay in `src/components/NavRopeOverlay.tsx`
- Active only on hover-capable devices
- Snaps to nearest active tile nav anchor (`data-nav-anchor="true"`)
- Line starts from ellipse boundary around anchor (does not cross button text)
- Line is hidden when cursor is directly inside anchor ellipse

## Content

- Site metadata loaded from `content/site-info.json`
- Project metadata source: `content/projects.csv`
- Project source media: `content/projects/<slug>/{images,videos,models}`
- Generated runtime index: `public/projects-index.json`
- Generator: `scripts/generate-projects-index.mjs`
  - Copies content media into `public/projects/<slug>/`
  - Uses semicolon-delimited CSV with columns including `approach` and `outcomes`
  - Supports legacy fallback from `public/projects/<slug>/` media when content folder has no assets

## Build/Validation

- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run check` (generate + typecheck + build)

All currently pass locally.
